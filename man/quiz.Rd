\usage{
quiz(..., title = "Quiz", show_box = TRUE, show_check = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Each argument should be a named vector, see Details.}

\item{title}{Atomic character, default: 'Quiz'}

\item{show_box}{Logical, whether or not to draw a box around the quiz.
Default: `TRUE`}

\item{show_check}{Logical, whether or not to show a button to check answers.
Default: `TRUE`}
}
\value{
`NULL`, this function is called for its side effect of printing HTML
code using `cat()`.
}
\description{
Convenience function for creating a basic quiz in HTML format
from the arguments captured by `...`, where the type of each question
is determined automatically from the class of the arguments.
}
\details{
The function renders questions captured by the arguments in `...`.
The name of each argument is the text of the question. The value of each
argument determined the question type and its correct answer. The following
types of questions are supported:

\describe{
 \item{"`torf()`"}{The argument should be a single value of type `logical`,
 e.g.: `"The answer to this question is true." = TRUE`}
 \item{"`mcq()`"}{The argument should be a vector of type `character`. The
 first element is taken as the correct answer; the order of answers is
 randomized. E.g.: `"This multiple choice question has three answers." =
 c("Correct", "Incorrect", "Not sure")`}
 \item{"`fitb()`"}{The argument should be of type `numeric`. If the vector is
 atomic, the first element is taken as the correct answer, e.g.:
 `"Provide an exact floating point answer of 0.81" = 0.81`. If the vector has
 two elements, the second element is taken as the tolerance `tol`,
 e.g.: `"Here, 0.8 will be correct." = c(0.81, 0.01)`. If the
 vector is of type `integer`, the tolerance is set to zero, e.g.:
 `"The answer is 4." = 4L`}
}

Alternatively, `...` may contain a single atomic character referring to a
text file that contains the questions, see examples.
